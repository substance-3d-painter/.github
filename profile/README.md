## What is Substance 3D Painter?

**Substance 3D Painter** is the industry-standard application for **3D texture painting and material creation**. Used by professionals in game development, film VFX, and product visualization, it allows artists to paint directly onto 3D models in a real-time PBR (Physically Based Rendering) viewport. With its non-destructive, layer-based workflow similar to Photoshop, you can create incredibly detailed surfaces, from realistic wear and tear to fantastical designs.

Substance 3D Painter empowers artists with features like **Smart Materials** and **Smart Masks** that automatically adapt to your model's geometry, dramatically speeding up the texturing process. Its integration with other tools like **Blender**, **Unreal Engine**, and **Unity** makes it a cornerstone of the modern 3D content creation pipeline. Whether you're texturing a character, vehicle, or environment, Painter provides the tools for unparalleled artistic control and efficiency.
